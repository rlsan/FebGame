# FebGame

A platformer passion-project being made with the [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/) framework.

## Map Editor

For this project I had to create an editor.

The editor is currently able to import and export tilemaps in XML. The GUI is custom-made, and was a necessity for an editor such as this.
